DISCLAIMER AND SAFETY NOTICE:

This software is designed to automate GUI interactions using AI/LLM technology.
Users are solely responsible for:

1. SAFE USAGE: Testing in safe environments before production use
2. DATA PROTECTION: Ensuring no sensitive data is exposed during automation
3. SYSTEM SECURITY: Maintaining secure API keys and configurations
4. COMPLIANCE: Following all applicable laws and regulations
5. SUPERVISION: Monitoring automated processes to prevent unintended actions

The authors and contributors of this software:
- Make NO WARRANTIES about the safety, reliability, or suitability of this software
- Are NOT RESPONSIBLE for any damages, data loss, or security breaches
- STRONGLY RECOMMEND thorough testing before any production use
- ADVISE AGAINST use with sensitive, critical, or production systems

By using this software, you acknowledge that:
